            <h1>Sport Schedule : </h1>
            <p>
                What’s so hard about scheduling games?
                The phone rings and you simply
                plug in the first, second, and
                third teams that call. You’re done in a jiffy.
                If it were only that simple. There are, however, a number of considerations to this seemingly
                straight-forward task which might make it easier.

                It is not unusual for many leagues to provide the basic schedule for all sports and an athletic director
                simply has to find opponents for non-league, open dates. This is a great start if you find yourself in
                this situation.

            <h1>Time Zones : </h1>
            <p>
                A time zone is an area that observes a uniform standard time for legal, commercial and social purposes.
                Time zones tend to follow the boundaries between countries and their subdivisions instead of strictly
                following longitude, because it is convenient for areas in frequent communication to keep the same time.

            <h1>Realtime Weather : </h1>
            <p>
                How do forecasters predict the weather? They look at the weather happening now and determine how it will
                change over time. Comprehensive and current weather data means more accurate predictions, and data that
                updates in real time is best.

            <h1>Astronomy Weather : </h1>
            <p>
                How can you tell when weather conditions will be best for astronomy?
                We reveal what to look out for and
                how to use the UK Met Office forecasts to help. <br>
                Nothing affects our ability to view the night sky more than the weather. Unless the sky conditions are
                favourable, hands-on astronomy is impossible, so the ability to recognise a potentially good opportunity
                for viewing or imaging in advance is very useful indeed.
